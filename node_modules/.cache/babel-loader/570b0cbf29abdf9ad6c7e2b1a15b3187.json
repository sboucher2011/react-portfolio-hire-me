Graduated from Florida Institute of Technology in 2013 with a Masters in Aerodynmaics and Propulsion. Started my professional career at Embrear Executive Jets as a Quality Engineer where I focused on aircraft documentation and airworthiness. Ended up developing multiple visual basic (VBA) codes to help improve data tracking. After Embrear I moved over to Boeing space division where I worked as a Mechanical Engineer on the Space Launch System (SLS) Rocket. I then went back to Embrear and worked as a Improveent Engineer where I devleoped multiple VBA codes to help automate program managment and action tracking. I then moved over to Lockheed Martin where I have had several different jobs over the past six years. Currently I am working as a Project Manager where I am responsible for the construction of a new production site in Troy, Alabama. On top of my main role I have also joined a software team where I am using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web-based application for data tracking. I am hoping that between this side job and the completion of my UCF Full Stack Certificate I will be able to transition into a developer role at Lockheed Martin. During 2020 quarenteen I decided to start my web development career by learning Swift and starting my own app development business. I have been working with a health and fitness company to design an app for their business; it is currently in beta testing!
